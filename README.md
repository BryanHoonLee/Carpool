#Carpool service

Jambee is an online carpool service designed for students. The goal is to connect commuters and create opportunities to carpool.

Is Jambee Only for Students to Use?
Yes, currently speaking, Jambee is only intended for students to use. Without a .edu email address a person cannot sign up for the service.
In the future, however, this service might be opened for other commuters to use. But for safety reason, this is only for students for now.
